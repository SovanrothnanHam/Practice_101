# The code line is defining a dictionary called inline_fn with two key-value pairs. 
# The first key is "sub_1" and its value is a lambda function that takes an argument x and returns x+1. 
# The second key is "var" and its value is the string "abc".
# The print statement on line 3 calls the lambda function with an argument of 2 and prints the result, which is 3. 
# The print statement on line 4 prints the string "abc".
